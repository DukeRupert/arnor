# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

arnor is a unified infrastructure management CLI/TUI for managing web projects hosted on Hetzner Cloud with DNS via Porkbun or Cloudflare. It wraps three component tools — `shadowfax` (Porkbun DNS), `gwaihir` (Cloudflare DNS), and `fornost` (Hetzner Cloud) — into a single interface.

## Build and Development Commands

```bash
go build -o arnor .          # Build binary
go run .                      # Run directly
go test ./...                 # Run all tests
go test ./internal/dns/...    # Run tests for a specific package
go test -run TestFunctionName ./internal/dns/  # Run a single test
go vet ./...                  # Static analysis
go mod tidy                   # Clean up dependencies
```

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **CLI framework:** Cobra + Viper for config
- **TUI framework (v2.0.0):** BubbleTea + Lipgloss + Bubbles
- **Env loading:** godotenv from `~/.dotfiles/.env`

## Architecture

### Key Design Principles

- Component tools (`shadowfax`, `gwaihir`, `fornost`) are imported as Go packages, not shelled out to as binaries. Their `internal/` client packages are the integration point.
- CLI functions must return structured data, not print directly to stdout, so the TUI layer (v2.0.0) can consume them without refactoring.
- No business logic in TUI models — the TUI is a thin wrapper over the same functions used by CLI commands.
- Mirror `.env` loading and error handling patterns from `shadowfax` for consistency across the suite.

### DNS Provider Interface

The central architectural piece. A common interface that both `shadowfax` (Porkbun) and `gwaihir` (Cloudflare) implement:

```go
type DNSProvider interface {
    CreateRecord(domain, name, recordType, content, ttl string) (string, error)
    DeleteRecord(domain, id string) error
    ListRecords(domain string) ([]DNSRecord, error)
}
```

Provider is auto-detected by inspecting the domain's nameservers.

### Project Structure

- `cmd/` — Cobra command definitions (root, config, project, server, dns, ssh)
- `internal/config/` — Config file read/write (`~/.config/arnor/config.yaml`)
- `internal/dns/` — DNS provider interface + Porkbun/Cloudflare adapters
- `internal/hetzner/` — Hetzner Cloud client adapter (wraps fornost)
- `internal/caddy/` — Caddy reverse proxy config generation
- `internal/project/` — Project creation orchestration
- `tui/` — BubbleTea models and views (v2.0.0)

### Project Create Orchestration

The core workflow (`arnor project create`) replaces the old `new-project.sh`:

1. Prompt for GitHub repo, server, environment, domain, port
2. Look up server IP from Hetzner API
3. Detect DNS provider from nameservers
4. Create DockerHub repo via API
5. SSH into VPS as `peon` — create deploy user, deploy path, docker group, SSH keypair
6. Write Caddy config, restart Caddy
7. Create DNS A record and www CNAME
8. Set GitHub Actions secrets (namespaced by environment: `DEV_*` / `PROD_*`)
9. Generate workflow files into `.github/workflows/` (one per environment)
10. Write project entry to config

### Environment Conventions

- **dev:** subdomain under `angmar.dev`, DNS on Porkbun, triggered by push to `dev` branch
- **prod:** root domain from client, DNS provider auto-detected, triggered by semver tag (`v*`) on `main`
- Deploy users: `{project}-dev-deploy` and `{project}-deploy`
- Port allocation is manual; convention is dev = prod port + 1

## Configuration

- Environment variables: `~/.dotfiles/.env`
- Config file: `~/.config/arnor/config.yaml` (generated by `arnor config init`, not hand-written)
- `peon.sh` is a prerequisite on target servers — verify `peon` user exists before running `project create`
